Lua server side competitive AssaultCube module.

This was written by Padfoot to address the problem that in AssaultCube, there is no reliable competitive module.
The closest is the w00p competitive client/server combo, but this requires you to run a binary that they provide,
and they refuse to provide you with a source code. This, on the other hand, is open source.
